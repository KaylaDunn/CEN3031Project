- What issues your team planned to address
  - We wanted to implement some basic homepage components and functionalities such as welcome elements, a login button, as well as image uploading.
- Which ones were successfully completed
  - We were able to complete issues #6, 8, 9, 13, and 16. Many of these were originally longer, and had to be split up into smaller issues that were reassigned to the next Sprint. 
- Which ones didn't and why?
  - We were able to complete the backend for issue #7, but there is still frontend work left until it can be closed. The complete log-on process still has work left as well, specifically the authentication.
