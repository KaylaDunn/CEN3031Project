# Sprint 2 Report #
- Detail work you've completed in Sprint 2
  - Created and set up Create Account page so that users can navigate to it from the Log In page and create an account if they do not have one. So far, the button on the Home page navigates to the Log In, where there are 2 buttons. The first one was completed last Sprint, but the second one navigates to the Create Account page. This is still missing data verification and inputting the account information into a database.
  - Implemented unit tests for all components. Unit tests are described below.
  - Connection of the frontend and backend systems.
  - <insert backend progress>
- List unit tests and Cypress tests for frontend
  - Each component now has a .cy.ts file, which contains its component tests.
  - Each component has a test for mounting, which mounts the component into the test app in order to run functionality tests.
  - Most components (header, createaccount, login, and welcome) have a functionality test that checks if its buttons are clickable.
  - The only component that does not have this test is the logsuccess, because it does not have any buttons and no functionality to test.
