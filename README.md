## Activio

##### Project Description:
For this project we decided to create a website that helps people find activities to do when in a certain area. Users will be able to create their own lists of activities and post it on the website. The ability to "like" posts and also upload photos of the activity/area will also be included in order to assume a priority list of what posts are seen first. Features include: commenting, photo uploads, search bar for finding a specific location, and ability to "like" posts.
